# Period Care In The Western World VS Eastern World 

## How Period Care Is Different In The Eastern World Vs Western World?

## Abstract
Period poverty worldwide is exposing women to toxic shock and other significant life-threatening infections. Menstruation is a part of the human process and women having access to feminine hygiene products is a necessity because it has significant impacts on women's health and well-being. inadequate menstrual care negatively affects women worldwide, causing disruptions in their daily lives and can even be as serious as causing life-threatening health conditions.
This project is important because it is vital to understand who is being impacted by period poverty and how it is impacting them to address the issue and mitigate harm. Research can help us allocate the right resources to communities of women worldwide. A global perspective is important to calculate how much money would need to be invested into women's health to give them equitable access to period care whether that be re-usable menstrual tools such as period discs, cups and underwear, or disposable period products.
